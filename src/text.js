    raytracerp: <p>A fully functional raytracer implemented in Rust. The raytracer can produce png images using shaders, lights, and mirrors! Currently supports rendering spheres, triangles, boxes, and OBJ meshes. Performance is optimized using a <span className='hoverable' title='data structure used to efficiently determine which objects in a 3D scene intersect with a ray. It works by organizing the objects in the scene into a tree-like structure, where each node represents a bounding volume that encloses a subset of the objects in the scene.'>Bounding Volume Hierarchy</span> to greatly reduce the rendering time.</p>,
    delayp: <p>A digitial delay plugin implemented in C++ using the <a href = 'https://juce.com/' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JUCE framework</a>. Audio delay is a common effect used in music production of all kinds, it involves a circular buffer of audio samples that is delayed from the original sound and then fed back into itself to create the following effect.</p>,
    pitchp: <p>This project is a pitch detector implemented in C++ using the <a href = 'https://juce.com/' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JUCE framework</a> to generate an audio plugin that can be used in DAW's to detect the note of a sound. Uses the <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fast Fourier transform</a> to get a list of frequencies in a sound at a given time, and matches it with the closest available note on the keyboard.</p>,
    thissite: <p>This website was created using ReactJs. This project was an intro to ReactJs for me and it turned out nicely. I plan on creating more react applications in the future but with more scale than this site. This site is a personal portfolio to show future employers/coworkers the work that I have done in a nice looking manner.</p>,
